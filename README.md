For A&E v2:
- replace the original files with the recovered ones (ex replace config.py with recovered_config.py)
- create empty directories 'imgs_condition', 'downloaded_models'
- make sure you have the huggingface model
- run download_clip.py to get clip (it'll be saved in 'downloaded_models')
- make sure prompts_json: condition_img is pointing to the right folder for the condition imgs
